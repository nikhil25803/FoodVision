## FoodVision
FoodVision is a **Python** project that effectively utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for food
**image classification**. The adoption of best practices, automation through
shell scripting, and the inclusion of both command line and GUI interfaces
contribute to its accessibility and usability. Future improvements aim to enhance
the model's performance and user experience.

## Customization?
If you are looking to enhance the model accuracy, run the `setup.sh` bash file to avail all the images you'll need for building the model.
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
> This will automatically download and unpack the zip file and will delete unnecessary data as well.
